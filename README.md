A. TP1_Solution.html

This file corresponds to the lab conducted during a course taught by Yoann Pradat, Julien Vibert, and Else Bernard at the IFSBM. The goal was to learn how to analyze TCGA data in R and apply classification tools through modeling, regression, and deep learning techniques.


B. Signal_Processing

These codes were developed during my current internship. Their purpose is to analyze data collected during transcutaneous Spinal Cord Stimulation (tSCS) experiments, which aim to enhance plasticity and motor responses in patients who have suffered a stroke or spinal cord injury.

    EMG_burst_final: An automated script used to analyze data from tSCS with continuous stimulation associated with a task. It compares the max-min values and area under the curve for each task window, normalized by the duration of each movement (detected through signal processing), and compares these results to data from recordings without stimulation.

    EMG_paired_final: An automated script for analyzing data from tSCS with paired-pulse stimulation. It compares the max-min of each response to each pulse and also compares consecutive pulse responses to assess potential post-activation depression.


C. Website

These codes were developed during my exchange semester in Chile for a Web Programming course. The backend and frontend components together allow a fully functioning website. The project was completed over three weeks, with the instruction to leave the code uncommented. This project enabled me to learn web programming from scratch.
